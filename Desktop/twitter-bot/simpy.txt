If you were mine you would not get the same
Moving on seems harder to do when the one that you love moves faster than you
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing.. trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
No more walking round with my head down..I'm so over being blue, crying over you
Should've known your love was a game
We get so lonely we pretend that this works
Felt those lips tell me 21 lies
I'm never gonna let you close to me even though you mean the most to me 'cause every time I open up, it hurts
Why you got me so obsessed with you?
You love when I fall apart so you can put me together and throw me against the wall
Must be love on the brain that's got me feeling this way
Say my name, say my name if no one is around you say baby I love you
Why can't you just tell the truth if somebody's there then tell me who
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
Now my baby's dancing but she's dancing with another man
I've got to move on and be who I am
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
Ever since the day that I met you, I knew you were the girl of my dreams
All I got is these broken clocks, I ain't got no time
It may seem like our fire has been a little burnt out we're tired
I've fallen in love for the first time
I put my heart into your hands
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight, it just wonâ€™t feel right
You had a lot of crooks try'na steal your heart
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
I need some real good lovin' 'cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
Your arms around me but your soul is somewhere else
I like my girls just like I like my honey: sweet
