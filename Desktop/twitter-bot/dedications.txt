I've been thinkin' 'bout you..Do you think about me still?
I'm just sayin', you could do better. Tell me have you heard that lately
Don’t, don’t play with her don’t be dishonest
Maybe you weren't the one for me.. But deep down I wanted you to be
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Why after all these nights, I still give you all my days
We've got so much history baby, maybe you and I were meant to be
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
You actin' kinda shady ain't callin' me baby
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
We carry on, what is our motivation?
Something about us doesn't seem right these days
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
My world's been spinning out of control, I just need you to hold
And you made me lose my self control
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada.. Gucci and Prada
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
That should be me, holding your hand
You've got that smile that only heaven can make
When you was just a youngin', your looks were so precious but now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
just let my love adorn you
What I am trying to say is that love is ours to make so we should make it
All I need is all your loving to get the blood rushing through my veins
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you
All the pretty girls in the world but I'm in this space with you
